# symath

A simple (and rather fast) symbolic math package for Common Lisp. I'm using it in my CFD-code generation project (not published yet), where it deals with huge expressions with thousands of terms, sometimes reducing their sizes to dozens of terms.

This is a really simple package, which implements just `(symplify expr)` and `(extract-subexpr expr subexpr)` functions. Here `expr` and `subexpr` is an algebraic expressions like `'(/ (+ a b) a)`, a simplified version will be returned.

Expression can contain numbers, symbols, subexpressions (functions) and arrays. 1D arrays will be treated as vectors, square 2D arrays as matrices. Matrices and vectors can be multiplied to numbers and other vectors/matrices. The method `(array-multiply x y)` is exported, overload it to implement tensor multiplication or something else.

In the expressions some special functions can be used:

- `(sqr x)` - multiple x to itself. Works with vectors (returns vector length) and matrices.
- `(vector ...)` - construct a vector from arguments.
- `(aref idx array)` - get array element.
- `(exp x)` - an exponent

These functions can be transformed during simplification, all other functions will be kept as is (but their arguments will be simplified). Trigonometry functions support is planned, but not yet implemented.

The simplification algorithm is rather complicated, it contains the following main steps:

1. All vectoir/matrix operations (if any) are implemented, producing final vector/marix, and each element is simplified separately
2. All functions with numeric arguments are computed, where possible
3. Term reduction is performed for divisions and subtraction
4. Bracketing common factors performed. Most common factors are extracted first

`(extract-subexpr expr subexpr &key expand)` function can be used to isolate specific subexpression. It will convert the `expr` into the form `(subexpr^n)*e1+e2`, and return `(values n e1 e2)`. If it cannot isolate the `subexpr`, it will return `(values 0 0 expr)`. If the `expand` is set to `T`, the `expr` and `subexpr` will be transformed to have a better chance for extraction - all brackets will be opened in `e1` and `e2`.
This function is a very simple utility function and does not perform any transformations to solve the equation, the `subexpr` must be present in the `expr` more or less explicitly:

```
(extract-subexpr '(+ (sqrt x) 1) 'x) ;; will return (values 1/2 1 1)
(extract-subexpr '(+ (sqrt (+ x y)) 1) '(+ x y)) ;; will also return (values 1/2 1 1)
```

`(get-polynome-cfs expr subexpr &key expand)` returns a plist like `((0 . cf0) (1 . cf1) ...)` where `—Åf0`, `cf1`, etc is a polynomial coefficients of `expr` against `subexpr`. The `expand` argument works in the same way as in `extract-subexpr`. **NB**: The resulting alist will contain only nonzero coefficients!

`(replace-subexpr e e1 e2)` - find and replace all occurrences of expression `e1` in expression `e` and replace them to `e1`, returning the modified expression. The second returned value will be number of replacements. The expression `e1` must be explicitly present in `e` to be replaced, but the function can find and replace, for example, a subexpression `(+ c d)` in `(+ a b c d e)`.

`(split-to-subexprs vcs &key temps (min-weight 0) (gen-tmp #'symath::gen-tmp-var) subst-self)` - extract most common subexpressions from equation system `vcs` and replace them to temporary variables.
The equation system must be in alist form: `((var1 . expr1) (var2 . expr2) ...)`. The function will return an extended equation system like: `((tmp1 . tmp-expr1) (tmp2 . tmp-expr2) ... (var1 . expr1) (var2 . expr2) ...)` where `tmp1...` are symbols (by default) representing temporary variables, holding subexpressions, which occurs multiple times in the original system. The second returned values will be a list of temporary variables. The `min-weight` parameter is a minimal "weight" of the expression to be moved into a temporary variable (see `symath::expr-weight` for details). The `gen-tmp` parameter is a function of single argument, which must return an unique object (a symbol, for example) which will be a new temporary variable. The function will get an expression as a parameter. If `subst-self` is `T` the function will substitute original variables in expressions, which has the same subexpressions inside. **WARNING:** Use with great caution if your equation system is self-depended or can have multiple assignments for the same variable.

The default `gen-tmp` will be the function inside `symath` package, which returns unique interned symbols with names like `symath::tmpXXXX` where `XXXX` is an unique number, increasing each time. To reset the counter before execution of your program, use the following macro:
```
(with-var-cnt-reset
  (split-to-subexprs ...))
```

**WARNING:** The library is in beta stage, it may be buggy, please don't rely on it completely, always test results for validity!
